* Flow

The todo  apps has  major flaw:  either they  restrict to  you a
specific timeline or  they do not.  So here  is the alternative:
=Flow.=

** Concepts

*** Card

- ~Card~ is a miniscule task that can not exceed 2 hour limit.
- There are no states inprogress or anything else. Either you do
  it or not.
- There are states five states:
  - today: supposed to be finished today.
  - later:  for  now   it  means  week,  but   you  can  specify
    differently in future
  - indefinite:  here  anything that  is  not  priority (it's  a
    treasure)
  - scheduled: self-explanotory
  - deadline: self-explanotory
- There are three effors level : low, med and high

*** Flow
Now above discuss  concept are nothing new and  hence here comes
how it works

- At the end  of the day, you finish the  day manually, if there
  are any  cards(tasks), undone,  it will  notify you  to either
  finish it or, replace it with  tasks with similar tags as well
  as  effort  level,  or  manually  replacing  with  other  task
  whatever you want.
- This specefic process above, allows  you to change the task if
  doesn't works out.
- The daily tasks are added  automatically after you finish your
  day.
- You will be prompted a task from indefinite daily, and you can
  add it  today. (This  perticular process can  be customizable,
  and based on recommendation system)
- Effort level  in future will be  used to calculate or  load of
  the day, and recommendation will be based on that metric

*** Features
It's in  beta part and  works perfectly,  but most of  the tasks
=flow= is supposed to do, are still manual.
